# erugo

erugo is a powerful, self-hosted file-sharing platform built with PHP and Laravel with a Vue.js frontend. It offers secure, customisable file-transfer capabilities through an elegant user interface, giving you complete control over your data while providing a seamless experience for both senders and recipients.

## Demo

Check out a sample share on our demo site at [demo.erugo.app/shares/tight-silence-sweet-sea](https://demo.erugo.app/shares/tight-silence-sweet-sea). While uploads are disabled on the demo, you can experience the recipient's view and download the sample file.

Please note we're running the demo on a very cheap VPS so it may take a few seconds to load. This isn't an indication of the performance of the software, just our budget ;).
